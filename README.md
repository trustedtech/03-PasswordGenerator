# 03-PasswordGenerator

This password generator has a friendly, responsive UI in HTML/CSS and uses Javascript to gather and process criteria from the user to generate a complex, random password.   

The Javascript makes use of some useful functions/methods such as .split() , Math.random() , and Math.floor().  It also uses a blend of conditional logic and loops to achieve the proper results.

I enjoyed making this program as it helped solidify some important coding concepts for me.  Great challenge!
